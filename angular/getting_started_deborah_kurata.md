# Getting Started with Angular (Deborah Kurata)


These are my study notes for the coure [Angular: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-getting-started-update/table-of-contents) from Deborah Kurata, on pluralsight.

The course duration is 5h43m.

	git clone https://github.com/DeborahK/Angular-GettingStarted.git
	cd .\Angular-GettingStarted\

The main demo app is "APM" which stands for "Acme Product Management"

Under the `APM-Start` folder, here's the initial structure

    ├───e2e
    │   └───src
    └───src
        ├───api
        │   └───products
        ├───app
        │   ├───home
        │   └───shared
        ├───assets
        │   └───images
        └───environments

The web application itself is under the `APM-Start\src` folder. All the files in the `APM-Start` folder itself are there to support the tooling and the language and the frameworks etc. Go into the `src` folder for the real stuff.


## Lessons


### Introduction

- Angular is a javascript framework for building client side applications.
- Composed of "Components". Components are put together into modules. 
- There is always at least 1 module, the Root Angular Module.
- A component has: a class (with properties and methods), some metadata, a template.
- Code is generally written in typescript, in es2015, and transpiled down to es5 (hint: use vs code)
- Create "services" for getting data in/out. Probably for other things too.

## First things first

- Some javascript background. Javascript is "ecmascript" in the standards. All browsers support at least es5. es2015 is nicer, has arrow functions etc (and was formerly known as es6). May need to transpile it back down to es5. 
- typescript definition files -- those are the ones that end with *.d.ts



setup environment:

- need npm
- use npm to get angular
- get npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download

Already have it? check you have version at least `6.9.0` (from 2019)

    npm --version
    6.14.1

Fiiiine.

**But how do we get the angular cli?**

	npm install -g @angular/cli

That's how you get the super dooper useful angular cli.



Basic angular application has:

- package definition and configuration files
- packages
- root app angular module
- main.ts file
- host web page (index.html)

Can use angular cli to do all this...


In:

	~\learning\Angular\Angular-GettingStarted\APM-Start\
	
Run:

	npm install


There will be some warnings and a bunch of mess, but it will hopefully succeed at installing all the packages required by your little app.

Hmmm.

Warning near the start....


	core-js@2.6.11: core-js@<3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js@3.


...and eventually a bunch of fatal errors.

Ok, i'll run it a second time. This time it ran quicker but failed because of a locked file called something `pinkie`.

OK I restarted my console and ran it a 3rd time.

This time it "succeeded" What a mess.

We know it succeeded because it had this line in the output...

	added 1074 packages from 1046 contributors, removed 1 package, updated 2 packages, moved 1 package and audited 17156 packages in 104.591s

But also this line...

	21 packages are looking for funding
		run `npm fund` for details

..okay. And this:

	found 7 vulnerabilities (2 low, 3 moderate, 2 high)
		run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details

(OK -- I ran `npm audit fix` and that stopped me from being able to use anything. Then I checked at the course discussion group and a lot of people did that and Deborah told each of them "no please don't run npm audit fix, that will stop it from working. So just ignore those errors. As a result of running `npm audit fix` I had to delete the repo and re-clone it. So don't do that.)

NOW when I run:


	npm start

...it starts and I get to the welcome screen:

When we run `npm start` we are `run`ning an npm `script` like this:

if you look inside the file `package.json` you will find a node like this:

		"scripts": {
			"ng": "ng",
			"start": "ng serve -o",
			"build": "ng build",
			"test": "ng test",
			"lint": "ng lint",
			"e2e": "ng e2e"
		},

Those scripts are a map of friendly little names on the left to 'complex' commands on the right.

So when we run `npm start` it is a shortcut to running:  `npm run ng serve -o`
