# THINK! Before it's too late Edward DeBono



The only thinking we're traditionally taught is problem solving. But this isn't enough.

We need to learn tools of thinking.

# Why we Sleep Dr Matt Walker



Melatonin rises after dark before bed. It falls when we wake at dawn and lowers from regular light/dark cycles (particularly blue light)


Adenosine - keeps rising until we sleep. Caffeine interferes with it. An evening nap clears some out and makes it hard to sleep later.


## Sleep hygiene

1. reduce caffeine intake
2. reduce alcohol intake
3. remove screen technology from bedroom
4. reduce bedroom temperature (may involve lighter nightwear and bedding)



Establish regular bedtime - even on weekends

Go to bed only when sleepy

Avoid early mid evening naps (Eg on couch)

Never lie in bed awake for a significant time period



If having difficulty sleeping at night avoid daytime napping



Learn to mentally decelerate before bed to reduce night time anxiety provoking thoughts



Remove visible clock faces from bedroom (can create clock watching anxiety)



Finish workouts at least 2 to 3 hours before sleep.



Exercise will generally improve sleep. Sleep will powerfully improve exercise.





Problems with lack of sleep (<8 hours)



Body:

Heart disease

Cancer

Diabetes

Weight gain

FILE:StoneHeen_Feedback.md
# Thanks for the feedback





Feedback can have a main purpose of being

* Evaluation
* Coaching
* Appreciation (Compliment/encourage/motivate)

If you ask for feedback, expecting one type and receive another: friction!

If one type was meant (Eg coaching) and another type was perceived (Eg evaluation) then, woah friction!



Try to be clear about which type you want if requesting it

Discuss the purpose of the feedback if giving it (or receiving it)

Clarify what type of feedback they want before you prepare and deliver the feedback.



Be careful when coaching because all coaching includes *some* evaluation.



Feedback is based on:

Data and interpretation
They give the interpretation without the data. Eg a label without telling you why that label is applicable.



"Wrong" feedback may not be wrong: just different context, interpretation, culture, history, priority, implicit rules, values, definitions. So dig deeper don't reject outright.



Individual variations in:

* Baseline
* Swing
* Sustain
* Recovery


General things:

FILE:Duckworth_Grit.md
# Grit Angela Duckworth



Grit scale https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/



Darwin was a plodder. Thought hard work more important than talent.



We have an unconscious bias toward believing the talent myth. Even if we say we prefer people who've earned their skill over naturally talented people, when tested we favor the supposedly natural musician or natural entrepreneur.



"The mundanity of excellence."



When we don't understand excellence we fall to labeling it talent. (Same as that blog post I read about the guy who was a terrible singer then sung every day for ten years and then people would say "oh it's easy for you, you're a natural")



But high level performance is an accretion of mundane acts.



Nietzsche - no one can see in the work of the artist how it has become. That is its advantage. For wherever one can see the act of becoming, one grows somewhat cool.



"The cult of the genius" is promoted by vanity and laziness



Nietzsche says you must employ the means available to you. Employ everything as material.



Nietzsche: Great things are accomplished by those "whose thinking is active in one direction. Who employ everything as material. Who always zealously observe their own inner life and that of others. Who perceive everywhere models and incentives. Who never tire of combining together the means available to them."



Nietzsche said exemplars of talent are, above all else "craftsmen": "Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents. One can name great men of all kinds who are very little gifted. They acquired greatness. Became 'geniuses' They all possess that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole. They allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little secondary things well, than in the effect of a dazzling whole.







Talent * Effort = Skill



Skill * Effort = Achievement





Effort has a squared effect v talent.

(Talent makes it quick to gain a skill - but so does effort. Effort also makes you apply the skill you've gained. Thus effort leads to a squared amount of achievement versus the achievement outcome of talent without effort)





Warren Buffet story about "write down your 25 career goals. Pick 5. The other 20 are your 'must not do' list as they are the things that will suck up your passion, consume your time and energy and prevent you from completing the top 5." (I could call this the displacement effect)



Consistent work towards one life philosophy - a passion topic - a compass needle - a direction.

Lower level sub goals also serve this high level goal. Other sub goals are a means to an end.



To find your one life philosophy - write down all your mid level career goals.



Then graph them. Axes: interest and importance. See which are in the winning quadrant.





"The maturity principle (by which we may get grittier as we age) comes down to this: Over time we learn life lessons we don't forget. We adapt in response to the growing demands of our circumstances. Eventually new ways of thinking and acting become habitual. Over time our adaptations become durable. And eventually our identity (the sort of person we see ourself to be) has evolved. We have matured."





## Part 2 develop your passion



The grittier a person is the few career changes they're likely to make.







"All human beings even from infancy tend to look away from things they've already seen and instead turn their gaze to things that are new and surprising. Interest comes from the Latin interessa which means to differ. We are by our nature neophiles."



Experts see more nuance in their topic. They develop this by deepening their interest which only happens over time. By sticking at the same interest you break through and see more nuance. This is part of why they don't get bored with it. They see novelty within what a non expert would think is the same stuff over and over. Eg musician with notes painter with colors photographer with composition.



This is similar to Kathy Sierra in badass talking about how experts see in higher definition.



Or how people said of da Vinci that it was as if he was observing the world in slow motion. He was an expert at observation so he saw better.



Practice



Deliberate practice is very good



See my toned ear practice log where I'm doing deliberate practice. Daily. Reflective. Measured. Tiny-stretch-goal oriented. Reach one goal find another.



Ben Franklin had a way of doing deliberate practice of writing.

Putting favorite essays aside and rewriting them. Then comparing to find weaknesses.
Cutting the steps of an essay into pieces. Putting aside until forgotten. Then attempting to reassemble the logical structure.




More likely to practice/stick at it if working on something outside of yourself anddd interest self interest.



Other interested ness is important to success.



A top-level other-oriented life-organizing goal.





"Job-crafting" altering your job to make it more engaging. Maneuver within your job description, adding delegating and customizing what you do to tie to match interest and values. Amy Wrzesniewski.



Hope. "Fall seven rise eight."

Belief that I *can* alter the future.















Grit and growth mindset are strongly correlated.



"Just telling someone they can overcome adversity isn't enough. You have to rewire the brain circuitry" (the connection between the amygdala and the limbic system.) "by experiencing mastery at the same time as adversity".



A way to improve the world would be to create more extra curricular multi year activities for poor kids. Activities that are challenging and fun and rewarding.



Learned industriousness. <- name for related study.



Another name for grit is "follow-through" see studies on personal qualities by wallingham produced for ETS. "Purposeful continual commitment to particular areas versus sporadic effort in diverse areas." "Multi-year" participation with achievement versus itinerant participation switching every season.



Learn this cycle: struggle followed by progress followed by confidence.



Kids pick up on behavior more than lectures.



Structured extra curricular activities - Eg martial arts. Good for grit. One of few things that is both challenging and fun. Important to stick at it for more than 1 season.



Optimistic self talk helps growth mindset and presumably grit.



"As a transition to the final section of this book, 'building resilience from the outside in', I offer the following anecdote." <- transitions.



Parenting style should be:

Demanding AND Supportive

(Picture 4 quadrants with those on/off)

-warm respectful and demanding



Short survey about parenting style (for the children to take) parenting assessment by Nancy Darling Eg http://www.academia.edu/33702619/Parenting_Style_and_Its_Correlates -there may be better links than this



Cody says "If you try you have a chance. If you never try, you have no chance at all." - you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.



From elsewhere: "Perseverance is merely stubbornness with a purpose"



Elsewhere: impulsiveness is the opposite of grit/resilience/mindset/ -- see https://whydoiprocrastinate.com/#



Opposite of grit: being a flake. Impulsive. Low self control.



Be on time to things.



Don't use synonyms. Use limited vocals. Words with very specific meanings. Imbue meaning into the words. Like a worn down path. Reminds me of Scott Hanselman talking about being "intentional".



Good leadership like good parenting is supportive AND demanding.



3 virtue clusters:

Intrapersonal (Eg grit, self control, mental health) aka resume virtues.
Interpersonal aka eulogy virtues (according to David Brookes)
Intellectual - curiosity and zest, engagement with the world of ideas.



FILE:Hudson_Idea.md
# The idea generator, Ken Hudson



You look at the problem p1 through a lens l1 ... all your ideas are going to be similar.



Try a different lens l2 for looking at the same p1



Or try looking at a different problem p2



Different lens is also called a different mindset.



Some would call it reframing.



Having a single l1 p1 leads to a feeling of being STUCK. This is psychologically damaging. Destructive.





List of Tools for generating ideas (solutions to problems)





What different lenses can you use? The thinking hats 🎩 is a more specific version of this technique. Can I vent whatever lenses I want. Eg how would a tester see this problem? How would a conman think about it? It's also known as reframing isn't it.



Pick a letter of the alphabet and pick several types of people or profession for that letter. Eg A - astronaut 👩‍🚀 architect agent 👨‍💼 angel 👼 what sort of solution or problem description would each of those prefer?



How can we rephrase the problem in

* rational language 🐀
* Emotional language ❤️
* Inspiring imaginative language ⛅️


Think in threes not twos (the pmi is an example of this) instead of plus/minus, pass fail, good bad, divide things in three ways. (Similar variant beyond binary thinking - put things along two axes that are continuous not just plus minus)











Making a problem worse can sometimes bring out a more original solution.





Note: this book is largely about divergent thinking practices. And other books I've been focused on are about convergent thinking practices. Your ability to switch between divergent and convergent thinking styles is critical if you conceive and deliver entire projects and or work on a project at all stages.



A product or presentation or sales pitch must have three types of appeal:

Emotional (they must love it with their heart, be reassured that support and quality won't disappoint )
Logical (they must be rationally persuaded, price trading terms)
Imaginative (inspiring, interesting, engaging, surprising, entertaining)

Everyone should/can have a side hustle. Gives you more security (i'd add confidence and economic common sense)



Keep your day job.



There's no rules: Product or service, scalable or not. No cost or low cost.



A good idea must be:Feasible profitable and persuasive.



Hustle is Service or product

Product is tangible or intangible



Starter ideas versus NLIs: Next Level Ideas:  NLIs are ones that are scalable beyond your normal labor and or where the customers/goods are replenished





Five qualities to measure when ranking and comparing ideas:

1. Feasible (possible to even do it, low cost)
2. Profit potential (clear path to profit)
3. Persuasive (are people compelled)
4. Efficiency (can it be done quickly)
5. Motivated  (how interested are you)




Idea checklist

1. can you describe in one sentence
2. is there an obvious way to make money?
3. Does it solve a problem for someone?
4. Can you make it happen quickly?
5. Low maintenance?
6. Can you get paid more than once?

# Why? Mario Livio

Epistemic curiosity is the type Einstein had in abundance



Specific curiosity - when u want to know what film that actress was in



Diversive curiosity - restless desire to explore.   Seeking of novel stimulation to avoid boredom. Checking for new email. Impatient etc.



Empathic curiosity - trying to understand a person as in citizen Kane plot



Morbid curiosity - can't look away



Details about Leonardo

He started many more projects than he finished

He was not well read (thankfully! As his experiments were not this hampered by too many wrong ideas.) He started by using science to improve his art but finally used art to improve his science.



"Cyberchondria" "a diagnosis based on apparent symptoms that is induced by an internet search"





Novelty can be mapped on these axes:



Specific <---> diversive

    A specific thing that once found will satisfy the seeking, or diversive: the ceaseless seeking to ward off boredom





Perceptual <---> epistemic

   Perceptual is aroused by surprising novel or ambiguous

    Epistemic is the genuine yearning for new knowledge





Wait - isn't there arousal toward stimulation and secondly satisfaction of the arousal - and you may need to classify it based on both ends of the curiosity arc



Four factors that lead to things being worthy of curiosity:



Novelty

complexity

uncertainty and

conflict







Curiosity is a cognitive induced deprivation- an information gap



Eg in sudoku we have a clear information gap - small enough that we can fill it and we must fill it



Having filled it a new gap is thus made smaller and within reach - or we believe it is and then we must fill that - and so on.



(Could We model the size of the information gaps at each stage of a game of sudoku, and work out if or when it is maximally satisfying - when are people least likely to lose interest? - and from this develop genetic algorithms that evolve novel games with maximally enjoyable rulesets? Again modeling the human brain in some rudimentary way is an obvious need of such systems. A definition of fun. )
