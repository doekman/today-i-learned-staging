1. Simple (core) (simple and profound, proverb like) the commanders intent. The lede. Compact.
2. Unexpected- surprising interesting violate expectation counter-intuitive make people curios
3. Concreteness - not abstract, specific, may use concrete metaphors/examples
4. Credible - can test for yourself, backed with guarantees, authority
5. Emotions - people must care. An individual over a statistic. Many emotions to choose from: fear resentment compassion disgust
6. Stories.
